        <h1sytle="background color_color:pink":color:black:>Harshitha is not just the girl I love — she is my world, my heartbeat, my everything. From the moment I open my eyes to the time I close them, she lives in my thoughts, 24/7. Sometimes, I feel like she's more than just my love — she's my future wife, my guiding light like a mother, and the most precious soul I've ever known. In her, I see every emotion, every reason to smile, and every dream I want to live. I promise to love her with every breath I take, until my very last.</h1>
